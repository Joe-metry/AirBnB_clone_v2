A Simple Overview of What Flask is:
-----------------------------------

Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework that
allows developers to quickly build web applications.
It follows a minimalistic approach, providing only the essentials
needed for web development. With Flask, you can define routes to
map URLs to specific functions and render dynamic HTML templates
using the Jinja templating engine. It is WSGI-compliant, allowing
for easy deployment on various web servers. Flask has a vibrant
ecosystem of extensions that provide additional functionality,
such as database integration and authentication. Its simplicity
and modular design make it suitable for small to medium-sized
projects or rapid prototyping.
